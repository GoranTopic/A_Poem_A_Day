After great pain, a formal feeling comes–
The Nerves sit ceremonious, like tombs–
The stiff Heart questions "was it He, that bore,
And "Yesterday, or Centuries before"?

The Feet, mechanical, go round–
A Wooden way
Of Ground, or Air, or Ought–
Regardless grown,
A Quartz contentment, like a stone–

This is the Hour of Lead–
Remembered, if outlived,
As Freezing persons, recollect the snow–
First– Chill– then stupor– then the letting go–
